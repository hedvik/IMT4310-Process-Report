\chapter{Results} \label{chap:results}
In the duration of the course we created a prototype for the game Conductor Hero (see Figure~\ref{fig:conductor_hero}). A fully playable prototype for a VR conducting game. The game is available at GitHub\footnote{\url{https://github.com/Per-Morten/imt4310_conductor_hero}} and a video demonstrating the gameplay can be found on youtube\footnote{\url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQQTDyfQb-Q}}. 
We discovered through the creation of this game that the group worked well together, and low number of conflicts and a high amount of cooperation.
